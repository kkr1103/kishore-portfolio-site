                    <h2>Career aspiration</h2>
                    <p>As a first-year Cybersecurity student, I’ve spent a lot of time shaping a career plan that’s both realistic and personally motivating. From lectures, guest speakers, and my own exploration of the cybersecurity job market, I’ve come to define a clear two-stage path: beginning as a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, then moving into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) later in my career.</p>

                    <p>Starting in a SOC role is ideal because it places you on the front lines of an organisation’s security operations. SOC Analysts are responsible for identifying, responding to, and investigating security incidents in real time. What drew me to this role is the fast-paced, analytical nature of the work, and the opportunity to protect real systems from live threats. A recent industry lecture highlighted just how rapidly digital estates are growing — with 61% more devices to manage and a 42% increase in users since 2020. These numbers show why SOC Analysts must be prepared to work at scale, with both efficiency and precision.</p>

                    <p>From my research and industry insights, the skills most important for a SOC Analyst include working with SIEM tools such as Splunk, IBM QRadar, and ArcSight. These are essential for centralised monitoring and detecting patterns, such as failed logins or network anomalies. Analysts also need strong knowledge of network protocols and malware behaviours, along with basic scripting in Python, Bash, or PowerShell to automate common tasks. Skills in threat intelligence, forensic investigation, and familiarity with security practices across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments are also crucial.</p>

                    <p>To begin preparing for this role, I’ve completed a foundational cybersecurity course and am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification. These have strengthened my understanding of access controls, cryptography, and incident response. I’m also taking the CEH course to explore how attackers think, which adds depth to my defensive understanding.</p>

                    <p>I’ve reinforced my learning through job simulations from Mastercard, PwC, and Deloitte. These gave me hands-on scenarios like phishing analysis, reviewing logs, and responding to incidents — helping me apply my knowledge practically.</p>

                    <p>Looking long term, I aim to transition into a GRC role. This side of cybersecurity focuses on risk management, policy creation, and ensuring compliance with standards like NIST, ISO 27001, and GDPR. Unlike SOC roles, GRC requires more strategic thinking and policy-level communication. Key skills here include conducting risk assessments, writing audit-ready documentation, and understanding how to align IT systems with organisational and legal requirements.</p>

                    <p>To support this shift, I’ve also worked on improving my professional communication. Completing a LinkedIn Learning course on communication has made me more confident in explaining technical issues clearly and collaborating effectively across teams — a vital asset for GRC.</p>

                    <p>In summary, the pathway I’ve mapped out combines technical strength with professional development. I feel confident that the skills I’m gaining now will help me not just enter the cybersecurity workforce, but adapt and grow into more strategic roles over time.</p>
