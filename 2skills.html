                <p>Reflecting on my current skillset, I feel confident that I’m beginning to build the right foundations for a career in cybersecurity, specifically as a SOC Analyst in the short term and in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) further down the line. Through a combination of academic study, practical simulations, and independent learning, I have begun to align my development with what is required by the industry.</p>

                <p>To be effective as a SOC Analyst, there is a clear need for both technical and analytical capabilities. From my research and industry lectures, one of the most important areas is proficiency with SIEM tools such as Splunk, IBM QRadar, or ArcSight. These are used to monitor centralised logs, spot unusual patterns like repeated failed logins or sudden traffic spikes, and investigate suspicious behaviour. While I haven’t yet worked directly with these platforms, I’ve studied how they work and understand their practical applications.</p>

                <p>A SOC Analyst must also understand network protocols such as TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP, as well as how firewalls and proxies interact with traffic. This is crucial when interpreting logs and spotting abnormalities. Alongside this, threat intelligence and malware analysis skills are growing in importance. SOC teams now need to not only detect threats but also understand how malware behaves and how different threat actors operate. Learning this has helped me connect the dots between what attackers are trying to do and how defenders should respond.</p>

                <p>Incident response and digital forensics also play a key role in SOC work. Analysts are expected to contain and investigate breaches, document evidence, and often contribute to post-incident reporting. I’ve been able to gain early exposure to this through simulations such as those by Mastercard, PwC, and Deloitte, where I participated in mock phishing investigations and supported breach recovery tasks. While these were simplified, they introduced me to how real teams work under pressure.</p>

                <p>In terms of systems knowledge, I’ve made sure to build familiarity with the security features of Windows, Linux, and macOS. Many SOC environments rely on multi-OS coverage, and it’s important to know how logs, permissions, and processes vary between them. I also developed a secure file system tool using Python as part of a university module, which included metadata inspection, file hashing, and suspicious file detection. This helped me understand how scripting can assist in automating security checks — a skill increasingly expected of analysts today. I’m continuing to strengthen this by practising with Python and Bash scripting, and I’ve also started exploring PowerShell.</p>

                <p>Analytically, a SOC Analyst needs to be able to recognise patterns, filter false positives, and act decisively. This requires strong critical thinking and attention to detail — two skills I’ve been improving through regular lab work and simulation tasks. It’s easy to miss subtle signs of compromise if you’re not methodical, so I’ve been working on taking a structured approach to both technical analysis and decision-making.</p>

                <p>In parallel, I’ve been improving my soft skills, particularly communication. SOC roles require incident documentation and briefing other teams — sometimes under pressure. I completed a “Communication Foundations” course via LinkedIn Learning, which helped me gain confidence in presenting findings and working effectively in a team. These skills also feed into my long-term goal of transitioning into a GRC role.</p>

                <p>GRC work requires a slightly different skillset, which I’ve also begun preparing for. Rather than focusing purely on incidents, GRC involves long-term risk management, policy creation, and regulatory compliance. The most important technical frameworks in this area include NIST, ISO 27001, and GDPR, which I’ve started exploring through online material and lectures. Professionals in this field must be able to carry out risk assessments, write policy documentation, and understand audit workflows. Effective communication is just as vital here, as many GRC professionals act as the bridge between security teams and business or legal departments.</p>

                <p>Overall, I believe I’ve made a strong start in developing both the technical and professional skills needed for my career goals. I know there are still areas for growth — especially in gaining hands-on experience with commercial SIEM platforms and compliance documentation — but I’ve built a learning plan around those gaps. The path ahead is clearer now that I’ve understood what each role requires and how my current progress maps to those expectations.</p>
