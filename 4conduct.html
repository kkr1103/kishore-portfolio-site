										<h1>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/shutterstock_575867869.jpg" alt="Professional Conduct" /></span>

									<p>Embarking on the BSc Cyber Security course at Nottingham Trent University has been a transformative journey. While the curriculum has introduced me to foundational concepts in networking, cryptography, ethical hacking, and digital forensics, it has also deepened my understanding of what it means to act ethically and professionally in the IT field. Initially, I viewed cybersecurity through a more technical and tool-focused lens, drawn by the excitement of solving problems and working with systems. However, this course has made me realise that professionalism and ethical conduct are just as critical as technical skill.</p>

									<p>As I progressed through modules involving group-based activities and lab work, I began to see how essential traits like teamwork, time management, integrity, and communication are in this discipline. Whether collaborating on secure system design or engaging in practical sessions, I found that mutual respect, accountability, and ethical decision-making significantly influenced the quality of both the process and the outcome.</p>

									<p>This shift in mindset led me to explore the BCS (British Computer Society) Code of Conduct, which provides a solid ethical framework for IT professionals. The code emphasizes values such as integrity, respect for privacy, the responsible use of technology, and continuous professional development. I’ve come to appreciate that these aren’t just theoretical principles — they guide how we communicate, handle data, and represent the profession in academic and workplace settings.</p>

									<p>By applying these principles in practice — from adhering to academic integrity in my assessments to supporting peers in group tasks — I’ve taken meaningful steps toward aligning my conduct with industry expectations. I also recognise where I need to improve. For example, I’m working on being more proactive in group discussions and more confident when presenting ideas. These are areas I’m actively developing through workshops, reflective exercises, and soft skill courses like LinkedIn Learning’s “Soft Skills for Information Security Professionals.”</p>

									<p>The support I’ve received from tutors and peers, especially in navigating challenges such as adapting to new teaching styles and managing language barriers, has been instrumental. It has helped build a sense of belonging and encouraged me to uphold professionalism even in unfamiliar or high-pressure situations.</p>

									<p>Looking ahead, I remain committed to upholding the standards outlined by the BCS Code. I aim to embody professionalism not only by advancing my technical expertise but also by acting responsibly, supporting inclusive environments, and contributing positively to the field of cybersecurity. By aligning my actions with these values, I hope to make a meaningful impact — both academically and, eventually, within the wider industry.</p>
